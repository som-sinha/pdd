# pdd
present development directory
I know this is probably stupid but I wanted to make something in python myself so I did it. It works tho, so that must be a good thing.

### Installation:
**Note: I have tested this on Linux only(Ubuntu 20.04 Foccal Fossa). However it should run on any unix-like system that uses bash/zsh**
1. Clone the files.
2. Using python3 from your terminal run pdd.py from its directory.
   
   `python3 /PATH/TO/pdd.py`

### Usage:
**Note: if using zsh, put this into your .zshrc**
                                          
```
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```
1. Open the directory where you're working in the terminal. 
2. run `pdd-here`.
3. From now on whenever you type ppd it will take you to that directory.
4. If you want to change the directory just run `pdd-here` again wherever you are working.

### Updates:
#### First version:
As I wrote this in a day's time, I wasn't able to focus on the readability. Currently the code is basically unreadable unless you are me! if so, I need to meet you ASAP. I would like to repeat, this is most probably useless to anyone and I wrote this just to get more comfortable programming. You can call this my first independent project.
